$0: Copy all Homebrew libraries into the macOS app bundle.
USAGE: $0 [-h] [-b homebrew_path] [exec_path]

OPTIONS:
  -h, --help    Show this help message and exit
  -b            Path to Homebrew installation (default: $homebrew_path)
  exec_pat      Path to the main executable in the app bundle
                (default: get from `brew --prefix`)

When macOS apps are linked to dynamic libraries (.dylib files),
the fully qualified path to the library is embedded in the binary.
If the libraries come from Homebrew, that means that Homebrew must be present
and the libraries must be installed in the same location on the user's machine.

This script copies all of the Homebrew libraries that an executable links to into the app bundle
and tells all the binaries in the bundle to look for them there.
