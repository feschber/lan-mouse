      Lan Mouse is a mouse and keyboard sharing software similar to universal-control on Apple devices. It allows for using multiple pcs with a single set of mouse and keyboard. This is also known as a Software KVM switch.
      The primary target is Wayland on Linux but Windows and MacOS and Linux on Xorg have partial support as well (see below for more details).
